Startup instructions for automatic darkbox data collection

The best way to start a new fiberQA scan is to go the following web page:
http://zeus.phys.uconn.edu/halld/tagger/fp-microscope/fiberQA-11-2015
and then append to the URL the following magic words
?newrun=XXX
where XXX is your initials, as the requestor of the run. This creates a
dummy directory in the fiberQA-11-2015 folder called newrun-requested
and waits. The fiberQA_cron.sh script should be invoked automatically
every minute or two on a host next to the darkbox, which I call "gluon2"
in these instructions. The fiberQA_cron.sh script notices the new instance
of newrun-requested in the fiberQA-11-2015 directory and starts a
sequence of events that eventually starts a DAQ run, sequences through
a series of Vbias settings to enable each fiber in the bundle, one at a
time, then end the run and analyze the data. The end result is a set of
histograms that are displayed in the web page at the URL listed above.

NOTICE: Certain conditions are required on the gluon2 and ROC computers
in order for all of this to work. If you have recently rebooted gluon2
or halldtrg5 (the ROC) this will not work until you take some actions
listed below.

1) On gluon2, start up a new vnc session using the command listed below.
   The user account under which this is done must be the same account
   that executes the fiberQA_cron script to initiate a run.

   $ vncserver -geometry 1900x1080 :23

2) Open the new vnc screen in a vncviewer. Open a new terminal and 
   start a new instance of ssh-agent in it, then load the ssh key
   coda_daq_key into the agent. If you need the password, see RTJ.

   $ ssh-add ~/.ssh/coda_daq_key

3) If step 2 completed successfully, you should be able to log from gluon2
   into halldtrg5 without a password, using a command like the following.

   $ ssh -i ~/.ssh/coda_daq_key halld@halldtrg5

   Once you have logged in, make sure that a symlink "data" exists in the
   ~halld directory and points to the nfs mount point of the filesystem
   where the darkbox data should be stored. Currently this should be
   gluey.phys.uconn.edu:/export/annex2/TAGM-tests but it may move in the
   future. Make sure that this mount point is visible and writeable by
   the halld user.
